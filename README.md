Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit
======================================

This package contains the core sources of the *Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit*. The *Myriad Toolkit* facilitates the specification of expressive and scalable data generation programs via a special *XML data generator prototyping language*. 

Data generation programs created with the Myriad Toolkit have out-of-the-box scale-out support and can therefore generate large synthetic datatets with complex statistical dependencies on a shared-nothing environment in seconds and minutes rather than hours and days.  

To get a running example of a simple generator created with the help of the Myriad Toolkit, check out the [vldb-demo](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/vldb-demo) package.

If you want to find more about the architecture and the features of the *Myriad Toolkit*, please follow the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/myriad/wiki) of this project. In the coming weeks will provide tutorials explaining how to bootstrap your own data generator and rapidly prototype them with the help of our custom, XML-based specification language.
