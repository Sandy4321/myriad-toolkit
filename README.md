Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit
======================================

This package contains the *Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit*. The *Myriad Toolkit* facilitates the specification of scalable data generation programs with complex statistical constraints via a special *XML data generator prototyping language*. 

The *Myriad Toolkit* uses advanced PRNG algorithms to implement offset-based access to the elements of the generated domain type sequences within a bounded time. This feature facilitates an efficient data-parallel execution mode. Data generation programs created with the *Myriad Toolkit* therefore can be scaled-out in a massively parallel manner in order to quickly generate large synthetic datatets with complex statistical dependencies.

First Steps
-----------

If you want to learn more about the *Myriad Toolkit*, please read the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/myriad-toolkit/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) and the [XML Specification Reference Manual](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/myriad-toolkit/wiki/XML-Specification-Reference-Manual).

To get a running demo of a simple data generator, please check the [vldb-demo](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/vldb-demo) package.
