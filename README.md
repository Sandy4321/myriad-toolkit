Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit
======================================

This package contains the core sources of the *Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit*. The *Myriad Toolkit* facilitates the specification of expressive and scalable data generation programs via a special *XML data generator prototyping language*. 

Data generation programs created with the *Myriad Toolkit* have out-of-the-box scale-out support and can therefore generate large synthetic datatets with complex statistical dependencies on a shared-nothing environment in seconds or minutes rather than hours or days.

To get a running example of a simple generator created with the help of the *Myriad Toolkit*, check out the [vldb-demo](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/vldb-demo) package.

First Steps
-----------

If you want to learn more about the *Myriad Toolkit*, please read the [Getting Started Guide](/TU-Berlin-DIMA/myriad-toolkit/wiki/Getting-started-with-Myriad) and the [XML Specification Reference Manual](/TU-Berlin-DIMA/myriad-toolkit/wiki/XML-Specification-Reference-Manual).

To get a running demo of a simple data generator, please check the [vldb-demo](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/vldb-demo) package.
